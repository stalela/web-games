## 🎮 Checkers Game Implementation Plan

### Game Overview
**Game Name:** Checkers (Draughts)
**Original GCompris Activity:** checkers
**Difficulty Level:** Medium (4/6)
**Target Age:** 8-12 years
**Estimated Hours:** 12
**Category:** Board Games / Strategy

### Educational Objectives

- **Rule Following:** Learn complex game rules and turn-based gameplay
- **Pattern Recognition:** Understand board patterns and piece movement
- **Sportsmanship:** Practice fair play and turn-taking
- **Problem Solving:** Develop tactical thinking and decision making

### Technical Implementation Details

#### Core Mechanics
- **Board:** 8x8 checkerboard (10x10 playable squares)
- **Pieces:** 12 red pieces (player) vs 12 black pieces (Tux/AI)
- **Movement:** Diagonal movement, mandatory captures
- **Special Rules:** King promotion, multiple captures in one turn
- **AI Difficulty:** 5 levels using draughts.js library

#### Game States
1. **Setup:** Initial piece placement
2. **Player Turn:** Select piece, show valid moves
3. **Movement:** Drag or click to move
4. **Capture:** Automatic capture detection and animation
5. **Promotion:** King creation when reaching end row
6. **Game End:** Win/lose detection

#### UI Components
- **Game Board:** 8x8 grid with alternating colors
- **Pieces:** Circular sprites (red/black) with king indicators
- **Move Indicators:** Highlight valid moves with colored circles
- **Control Panel:** Undo, Redo, Difficulty selector
- **Turn Indicator:** Shows current player
- **Score Display:** Pieces remaining for each player

#### Assets Required
- **Board Squares:** checkers-black.svg, checkers-white.svg
- **Game Pieces:** Red and black circular pieces

- **Drag --- Drop:** Phaser 3 input system
- **Animation System:** Smooth piece movement and captures
- **AI Integration:** Level-based difficulty scaling

#### Implementation Challenges
1. **Complex Rules:** Mandatory captures, king promotion, multi-jumps
2. **AI Integration:** Proper integration with draughts.js library
3. **Visual Feedback:** Clear indication of valid moves and captures
4. **Touch Interface:** Large touch targets for board interaction
5. **Animation Timing:** Smooth piece movement without blocking input

#### Accessibility Features
- **High Contrast:** Clear color differentiation
- **Large Touch Targets:** Minimum 60px interactive areas
- **Audio Feedback:** Sound cues for moves and captures
- **Visual Indicators:** Clear highlighting of selected pieces
- **Keyboard Support:** Arrow key navigation (future enhancement)

#### Testing Requirements
- **Rule Validation:** All checkers rules correctly implemented
- **AI Difficulty:** Progressive difficulty scaling verified
- **Touch Interface:** Works on tablets and touch devices
- **Performance:** Smooth 60fps gameplay with animations
- **Edge Cases:** Multi-capture sequences, king movements

### Development Phases

#### Phase 1: Core Board (3 hours)
- Implement 8x8 checkerboard display
- Add initial piece placement
- Basic piece sprites and positioning

#### Phase 2: Basic Movement (4 hours)
- Implement diagonal movement validation

- **draughts.js Library:** JavaScript checkers engine
- **Drag --- Drop:** Phaser 3 input system
- **Animation System:** Smooth piece movement and captures
- **AI Integration:** Level-based difficulty scaling

#### Implementation Challenges
1. **Complex Rules:** Mandatory captures, king promotion, multi-jumps
2. **AI Integration:** Proper integration with draughts.js library
3. **Visual Feedback:** Clear indication of valid moves and captures
4. **Touch Interface:** Large touch targets for board interaction
5. **Animation Timing:** Smooth piece movement without blocking input

#### Accessibility Features
- **High Contrast:** Clear color differentiation
- **Large Touch Targets:** Minimum 60px interactive areas
- **Audio Feedback:** Sound cues for moves and captures
- **Visual Indicators:** Clear highlighting of selected pieces
- **Keyboard Support:** Arrow key navigation (future enhancement)

#### Testing Requirements
- **Rule Validation:** All checkers rules correctly implemented
- **AI Difficulty:** Progressive difficulty scaling verified
- **Touch Interface:** Works on tablets and touch devices
- **Performance:** Smooth 60fps gameplay with animations
- **Edge Cases:** Multi-capture sequences, king movements

### Development Phases

#### Phase 1: Core Board (3 hours)
- Implement 8x8 checkerboard display
- Add initial piece placement
- Basic piece sprites and positioning

#### Phase 2: Basic Movement (4 hours)
- Implement diagonal movement validation
- Add piece selection and dragging
- Basic move execution and turn switching

#### Phase 3: Capture System (3 hours)
- Implement capture detection and execution
- Add mandatory capture logic
- Multi-jump sequence handling

#### Phase 4: Advanced Features (2 hours)
- King promotion system
- Win/lose condition detection
- Undo/redo functionality

#### Phase 5: AI Integration --- Polish (2 hours)
- Integrate draughts.js library
- Add difficulty levels
- Final UI polish and sound effects

### Success Metrics
- **Gameplay Accuracy:** 100% rule compliance
- **AI Performance:** Appropriate difficulty scaling
- **User Experience:** Intuitive touch controls
- **Performance:** Smooth 60fps gameplay
- **Accessibility:** WCAG 2.1 AA compliant

### Risk Assessment
**High Risk:** Complex rule implementation may require significant debugging
**Medium Risk:** AI library integration may have compatibility issues
**Low Risk:** Visual design follows established board game patterns

### Dependencies
- **draughts.js:** JavaScript checkers engine (already available)
- **Board Assets:** SVG sprites for board and pieces
- **Audio Assets:** Move and capture sound effects
